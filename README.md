# Cryptographic Techniques

## Overview

A collection of cryptographic techniques implemented from scratch in python.

## Techniques

### Ancient Cryptography

- [Ceasar Cipher](/caesar_cipher.py)
- [Polyalphabetic Cipher](/polyaphabetic_cipher.py)

### 19th Century Cryptography

- [One Time Pad](./one_time_pad.py)
- [XOR + One Time Pad](./xor_and_one_time_pad.py)

### Modern Cryptography

- [Diffie Hallman Key Exchange](./diffie_hellman.py)(WIP)
- [RSA](./rsa.py)(WIP)
- [Elliptic Curve Cryptography](./ecc.py)(Coming Soon)

## Usage

This serves as a learning material for me in my journey to learning cryptography. I hope it helps you learn as well.
